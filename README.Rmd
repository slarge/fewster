The goal of fewster is to ...

## Installation

You can install the released version of fewster from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("fewster")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:
B
``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("slarge/fewster")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}

# library(mgcv)
# (needed every session to attach the mgcv library)
# If you get an error, read the instructions at
# http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~fewster/gams/R/
# about installing the library mgcv.
library("fewster")
data(cb, package = "fewster")
indcb <- indsp.func(cb, c(4, 7, 10, 15, 20, 33))
# (calculates index curve for a variety of df)

cb.bootind.119.10 <- outer.boot.func(cb, 10, 119)
# (this is the bootstrapping: might take a minute or two for 119
# replicates)

sp.plot("cb", 10, cb.bootind.119.10, 1, 6, 1, conf=0.95)

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
